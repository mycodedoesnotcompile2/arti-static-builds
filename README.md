arti-static-builds
=================

Description
------------
The great ["arti"](https://arti.torproject.org/) tool, from the TOR project, automatically compiled when there is a new release.

The building workflow is [here](https://github.com/mycodedoesnotcompile2/arti-static-builds/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml).

See the [Github release page](https://github.com/mycodedoesnotcompile2/arti-static-builds/releases/) of this repository to access prebuilt binaries for different architectures (x64, arm5/7/64) and different libc (GNU, musl).
